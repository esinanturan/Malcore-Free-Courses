# Contributor Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of the **Malware Bible**, we are committed to fostering an open, respectful, and harassment-free environment for everyone—regardless of experience level, background, identity, or role.

We value collaboration from all corners of the cybersecurity community: reverse engineers, analysts, educators, students, researchers, hackers, and defenders alike. Contributions come in many forms—reporting bugs, submitting writeups, proposing ideas, sharing tools, improving documentation, and participating in discussions.
