# Contributing to the Malware Bible

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to the Malware Bible!  
This project is an open-source cybersecurity resource dedicated to the study, documentation, and education of cybersecurity. We welcome contributions from reverse engineers, analysts, educators, students, researchers, hackers, and defenders worldwide.

## Guiding Principles

- **Educational Focus**  
  All contributions must align with our mission of cybersecurity education, threat analysis, malware research, and reverse engineering. Content promoting illegal activity, unethical behavior, or the creation of live threats will not be accepted.

- **Respect and Professionalism**  
  Treat fellow contributors with respect. This is a collaborative learning space. Harassment, gatekeeping, or toxic behavior will not be tolerated.

- **Accuracy and Attribution**  
  Contributions should be technically sound, well-organized, and properly attributed if based on prior work or publications.
